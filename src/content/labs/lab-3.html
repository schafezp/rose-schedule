<P>
    In the exercise, you will use the notion of a linked-list to implement
    a queue data structure. Queues are heavily used in operating systems
    for various tasks. You will use pointers to create and maintain the
    queue. The functions to be implemented are described in the header
    file included in the project that you will checkout from your svn
    repository.

<P>
    <SPAN CLASS="textbf">Linked-list:</SPAN> A linked list is a data structure that contains
    a list of nodes. A node has two parts:

<OL>
    <LI>Data
    </LI>
    <LI>A pointer to next node
    </LI>
</OL>

<P>
    Typically, the last node in the list will not point to any other node;
    hence, its next node pointer will point to <TT>NULL</TT>. Using the
    next node pointer, it is possible to keep track of the entire
    linked-list and access any node in the list. A linked-list typically
    has a head pointer as shown in the figure below. The head pointer
    points to the first node in the list. The figure below shows a
    singly-linked-list.

<P>

<P>
    <SPAN CLASS="textbf">Using a singly-linked-list to implement a queue:</SPAN> A queue is a
    data structure in which a node is always added to the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">tail</SPAN> of
    the list and removed from the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">head</SPAN> of the list. It is a data
    structure with a <SPAN CLASS="textit">First-In First-Out (FIFO)</SPAN> discipline. To
    model this behavior, implement a singly-linked-list with a
    <SPAN CLASS="textbf">head</SPAN> and a <SPAN CLASS="textbf">tail</SPAN> pointer. The <SPAN
        CLASS="textbf">tail</SPAN> pointer
    points to the last node in the list or <TT>NULL</TT> if the list is
    empty. The <SPAN CLASS="textbf">head</SPAN> pointer points to the first node in the list
    or <TT>NULL</TT> if the list is empty. Each node in the list will
    have a pointer to the next node in the list or <TT>NULL</TT> if there
    is no next node.

<P>
    The structure for a queue instance, the structure for a node, function
    prototypes and their descriptions are available in <TT>queue.h</TT>.

<P>

    <OL>
        <LI>Checkout the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">Queue</SPAN> project in the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">lab3</SPAN>
            directory from your svn repository into your svn local workspace.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>In <TT>queue.c</TT>, implement the functions described in
        <TT>queue.h</TT>. You must use pointers as described in the header
        file and you must use a singly-linked-list with head and tail
        pointers. You are provided with <TT>driver.c</TT>
        to test your implementation. You may <SPAN CLASS="textbf">not</SPAN>
        modify <TT>queue.h</TT>.

<P>
    There are two different ways to organize a parent-children process
    hierarchy. The first is a process chain, in which the parent waits
    for each child process to complete before creating a new child. The
    second is a process fan, which we will be using for this lab. In a
    process fan the parent creates all of the child processes at once
    allowing them to execute in parallel. The figures below show a process
    chain, on the left, and a process fan, on the right.

            ALT="$n$"></SPAN> child processes
        that will run in parallel.

<P>
    Recall: In a process fan, the children processes are all created
    by the parent process at once. You need to enforce this fact by
    making sure that no child process forks.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Each child process should be assigned a local id named
        <SPAN CLASS="textbf">index</SPAN>, which corresponds to the order in which it was
        created. The first child process will have an <SPAN CLASS="textbf">index</SPAN> of
        1, second will have an <SPAN CLASS="textbf">index</SPAN> of 2, and
        so on.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Each process, including the parent process, will also have a
        start time and an end time.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>The process <SPAN CLASS="textbf">pid</SPAN> (the id returned to the parent from
        <SPAN CLASS="textbf">fork()</SPAN>), process start time and process end time for each
        child process should be stored in an appropriate structure.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>An array of such structures should be created to store
        process info for the n child processes. The entry for each child
        process will be indexed by the process's <SPAN CLASS="textbf">index</SPAN>.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Immediately before each child process is created, the parent
        should capture the current time and store it in the process info
        structure as the start time for that child process. The process
        <SPAN CLASS="textbf">pid</SPAN> should also be stored in the structure. The process
        start time should be captured using the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">gettimeofday(2)</SPAN>
        system call (``man -S 2 gettimeofday'' describes its
        usage).

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>In each child process, read the corresponding line in the
        file passed into the program (e.g. <TT>Files.txt</TT>). For
        example, the first process created should read the first line in
        the input file. If <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
                WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
                SRC="csse332_lab3-img1.png"
                ALT="$n$"></SPAN> is larger than the number of lines present
        in the file, the program should wrap back around to the first line
        in the input file, using the same file more than once.

        system calls</A>.
    Remember that ``<TT>myCopy</TT>'' takes two command line
    arguments: 1) the name (or path) of the input file (read from
    the source file by the child process); and 2) the name of the
    corresponding output file. If the input file name is
    <TT>filename.txt</TT>, then the output file name should be
    <TT>filename_index_out.txt</TT>. For example,
    <TT>FileOne.txt</TT> will correspond with
    <TT>FileOne_1_out.txt</TT> if the child process with index 1
    produces the output file.

    <LI>After a child terminates, the parent should print the
        child's <SPAN CLASS="textbf">index</SPAN> and its total time from creation to end of
        execution to the console in the following form:
<PRE>
Time for process &lt;index&gt; = &lt;calculated time&gt; microseconds.
</PRE>

<P>
    Note that the parent must get the termination time of the
    terminated process and the appropriate entry from the array of
    process info structures to compute the total time for that
    process. The end time for the terminated process should also be
    stored in its process info structure.

<P>
    </LI>
<LI>The parent process should measure its total execution time
    using using <SPAN CLASS="textbf">gettimeofday(2)</SPAN>. After all of the children
    have finished execution, the parent should print to the console
    that the children have finished, that the current process is the
    parent process, and print the measured total execution time before
    it exits. Ultimately, a parent's total execution time should be
    less-than or equal to the sum of the execution times for each
    child. Can you think of why that might be?
