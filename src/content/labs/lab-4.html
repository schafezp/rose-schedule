    Checkout the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">Threads</SPAN> project in the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">lab4</SPAN> directory
    from your svn repository into your local workspace. The
    <TT>Costs.txt</TT> file in this project should be used as a sample
    file for this part of the lab. Don't forget to compile with the

        <LI>In this program you will demonstrate your understanding of
            thread creation, thread synchronization, and POSIX thread
            management. Write a C program in the files <TT>threads.h,c</TT>
            that takes three command line arguments: 1) the number of threads to
            create, <SPAN CLASS="textit">n</SPAN>, 2) an input file, <SPAN CLASS="textit">fileIn</SPAN>, and 3) an
            output file, <SPAN CLASS="textit">fileOut</SPAN> (in that order). Your program should
            do the following:

<P>

    <OL>
        <LI>First, open the input file, <SPAN CLASS="textit">fileIn</SPAN>, and find the
            number of values (or lines) in the file. <SPAN CLASS="textit">fileIn</SPAN> contains
            a list of the average cost of living for various locations. Our
            goal is to sort these values in increasing order.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Use a loop to create <SPAN CLASS="textit">n</SPAN> parallel threads (a thread fan
        similar to the process fan from lab3), distributing the number of
        values evenly across each thread. You can either distribute the
        values to each thread in the loop that reads in the file, or read
        the entire file first and then distribute the values to each
        thread after the read.

<P>
    <SPAN CLASS="textit">Note:</SPAN> <SPAN CLASS="textit">n</SPAN> is used in the code we provided, however
    you must create storage space for <SPAN CLASS="textit">n</SPAN> and set it to the
    number of threads.

<P>

    <OL>
        <LI>Each thread will sort its group of values using a
            different sorting algorithm. In each thread, call one of three
            sorting algorithms (provided in <TT>threads.c</TT>). The first
            third of the threads created should use a brute force sorting
            algorithm. The second third should use bubble sort. The final
            third should use merge sort.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Each thread should track the time it takes to operate (use
        <TT>gettimeofday</TT>), starting upon creation and ending once the
        sorting is complete.

<P>
    </LI>
<LI>Each thread should print its <SPAN CLASS="textit">index</SPAN> (an int that
    represents the order in which the thread was created) and
    <SPAN CLASS="textit">total time</SPAN> (as described above) upon completion.

</LI>
</OL>

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>In a loop, the parent process should wait (using
        <TT>pthread_join</TT>) for each thread to complete. Once all of
        the of the <SPAN CLASS="textit">n</SPAN> threads have completed, the parent should
        call a user defined function that calculates the <SPAN CLASS="textit">maximum</SPAN>,
        <SPAN CLASS="textit">minimum</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="textit">mean</SPAN> values for each sorting
        algorithm. It should then print these values to the console.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>At this point the values should be semi-sorted: the first
        third should be sorted via the brute force method, the second
        third by the bubble sort method, and the third third by the merge
        sort method.

<P>
    </LI>
<LI>Finally, merge the results of each thread to create one
    sorted list. This can be done without the use of the <SPAN CLASS="textit">n</SPAN>
    threads. The sorted list should be written to <SPAN CLASS="textit">fileOut</SPAN>.

    from your svn repository into your local workspace.

<P>

    <OL>
        <LI>In this program you will demonstrate your knowledge of signal
            creation and handling (see <A NAME="tex2html1"
                                          HREF="http://space.wccnet.edu/~chasselb/linux275/ClassNotes/process/sigbasics.htm">Signal

                Signals</A> for more
            information on signals). The program will respond to and handle
            signals triggered by function calls, keyboard input, and terminal
            commands given by you, the user. One of the signals that you will
            trigger will allow your program to run the 'ps' command, which
            displays information about processes that are running on your
            computer. Your program will be able to gain more information about
            each running process and kill them individually if desired. It
            should do the following:

<P>

    <OL>
        <LI>Accepts 1 command line input, which should be the username
            you used to login to your computer.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Display a prompt to the console. This does not need to read
        in input, but simply show that the program is waiting.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>The first signal the program should respond to is
        quitting. Use the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">SIGINT</SPAN> signal (triggered by
        <TT>ctrl-c</TT>) to terminate the program. Remember, you can
        "<SPAN CLASS="textit">handle</SPAN>" a signal using the <TT>(void) signal(SIG,
            function pointer)</TT> function.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Next, use <SPAN CLASS="textbf">SIGALRM</SPAN> to trigger a beep on your
        computer every 5 seconds. While the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">SIGINT</SPAN> signal trigger
        is <TT>ctrl-c</TT>, the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">SIGALRM</SPAN> signal trigger is the
        <TT>alarm</TT> function. If you enter the command <TT>echo -n</TT>
        "<code>\007</code>" at a LINUX terminal then hit the <TT>Enter</TT> key, it
        should trigger a beep. You might want to create a child process
        that does the same thing in your program. You might also want to
        experiment with using the <TT>alarm(seconds)</TT> function to
        trigger the signal timer alarm. (<TT>man -S 3 alarm</TT> should
        describe its usage). You may print out a short output or reprint
        the prompt in addition to echoing the beep if you wish.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>If beeping does not seem to work properly on your machine,
        you may just wish to display a message to the
        console. Alternatively, you may try the following steps to enable
        sound:

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Your program should support the <TT>ps</TT> command, which
        returns a list of all current processes with their <SPAN CLASS="textbf">PID</SPAN>s
        (their process id's). It should use your provided
        <SPAN CLASS="textit">username</SPAN> to return only the processes associated with it
        by running the <TT>ps -u <SPAN CLASS="textit">username</SPAN></TT> command. For
        example if I run:

<P>
    <TT>./signal flintstones</TT>

<P>
    then <TT>flintstones</TT> is the provided <SPAN CLASS="textit">username</SPAN>. To do
    this, trigger the command on a <SPAN CLASS="textbf">SIGQUIT</SPAN> signal, which is
    generated by the <TT>ctrl-</TT><code>\</code> keyboard input.

<P>
    Do you need to create a child process to handle this? This is only
    a thought question--you can decide how best to handle this and
    the remaining signals.

<P>
    </LI>
<LI>Finally, the <TT>ps</TT> command would not be useful if we
    did not implement the <TT>kill</TT> command to kill
    processes. Your program should use the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">SIGUSR1</SPAN> signal to
    trigger a <TT>kill</TT> command. <SPAN CLASS="textbf">SIGUSR1</SPAN> signals should
    be triggered from another terminal with the <TT>kill -USR1
        PID</TT> command, where <TT>PID</TT> is the process id of an
    instance of this program. Your program should prompt the user for
    the process id of a process to kill. After reading the input from
    the user, from its terminal, the program will execute the
    <TT>kill</TT> command for the specified process.
