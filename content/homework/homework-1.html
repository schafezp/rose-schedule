    This assignment is due 07 December 2015 no later than 11:59 PM.

<P>

    <OL>
        <LI>Complete the Introduction to LINUX and C Programming tutorial
            that is linked from the <A NAME="tex2html1"
                                       HREF="../resources/resources.html">Resources
                page</A>, if you have not yet completed
            it.

<P>
    Note: There are two versions of this tutorial. Be sure to complete
    the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">appropriate</SPAN> one.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>If you have not yet installed Ubuntu or another LINUX
        distribution, instructions for installing Ubuntu are available
        <A NAME="tex2html2"
           HREF="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/resources/Ubuntu/index.html">here</A>.
        You should begin your installation as soon as possible. Your
        installation should be completed no later than the first Wednesday
        lab period.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>You have now gone through the steps of using Emacs to edit C
        program, working with the LINUX command line environment and
        compiling C programs from the command line. Do the following as a
        self-test. If you have problems doing this, the instructor and TAs
        are available to help you.

<P>
    During the next class your instructor may ask that you demonstrate
    that you have completed this assignment. For the purpose of this
    assignment $LINUX_HOST refers to either <SPAN CLASS="textbf">your laptop</SPAN>, if
    you have linux installed, or
    <SPAN CLASS="textbf">{abacus/sliderule}.csse.rose-hulman.edu</SPAN>.

<P>

    <OL>
        <LI>Login to $LINUX_HOST. Use SecureCRT to access abacus or
            sliderule if have not yet installed linux on your laptop.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Create a directory called <SPAN CLASS="textbf">HW01</SPAN>.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Using Emacs, create in <SPAN CLASS="textbf">HW01</SPAN> a C program file called
        <SPAN CLASS="textbf">MyFirstCProgram.c</SPAN>.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Edit MyFirstCProgram.c so that it prints the string ``This
        is my first Operating Systems C program.'' to the console. Look
        at the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">HelloWorld.c</SPAN> program for an example on how to do
        this.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Save the file.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Use <SPAN CLASS="textbf">ls</SPAN> to ensure that a file called
        MyFirstCProgram.c has been created.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>We will use the <A NAME="tex2html3"
                           HREF="http://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html">Google C++
        style</A>. Use
        <A NAME="tex2html4"
           HREF="../resources/cpplint.py"><SPAN CLASS="textbf">cpplint.py</SPAN></A>
        (this version has a couple of small local modifications to make it
        work better for C code) to make sure your code conforms to a
        reasonable style. You might need to make <TT>cpplint.py</TT>
        executable (e.g. by running ``<TT>chmod a+x cpplint.py</TT>'').
        You can check <TT>foo.c</TT> by running
        ``<TT><SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
                WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
                SRC="csse332_hw01-img1.png"
                ALT="$\sim$"></SPAN>/cpplint.py foo.c</TT>'' assuming <TT>cppylint.py</TT>
        is in your home directory. If <TT>cpplint.py</TT> is in a
        different directory, you'll need to include the path to it. If
        it's in the current directory the path to it is
        ``<TT>./cppylint.py</TT>.'' Note: you can place
        <A NAME="tex2html5"
           HREF="../resources/CPPLINT.cfg">CPPLINT.cfg</A> in the
        root of your directory tree to automatically load local
        configuration options. This config file will eliminate the
        copyright warning.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Compile MyFirstProgram.c using <SPAN CLASS="textbf">gcc</SPAN> with and without
        the ``-o'' flag and create the executables ``a.out'' and
        ``myfirstprog''.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Run each executable.

<P>
    </LI>
<LI>When done, logout of $LINUX_HOST.

</LI>
</OL>

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Submission instructions: You should submit only after you have
        initially checked out data from your svn repository (Follow
        <A NAME="tex2html6"
           HREF="../resources/svn.html">these instructions</A> to
        checkout your svn repository).

<P>

    <OL>
        <LI>Log back into to $LINUX_HOST and <SPAN CLASS="textbf">cd</SPAN> to the
            <SPAN CLASS="textbf">HW01</SPAN> directory.

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Use the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">mv</SPAN> command to your files to the
        <SPAN CLASS="textbf">HW01</SPAN> directory of your svn local workspace (that is, the
        directory that appeared in your directory tree after you checkout
        data from your svn repository).

<P>
<PRE>
&gt; mv MyFirstCProgram.c a.out myfirstprog &lt;svn local workspace&gt;/HW01
</PRE>

<P>
    </LI>
    <LI>Make sure the <SPAN CLASS="textbf">HW01</SPAN> directory of your svn local
        workspace contains the executables <SPAN CLASS="textbf">a.out</SPAN> and
        <SPAN CLASS="textbf">myfirstprog</SPAN> as well as <SPAN CLASS="textbf">MyFirstCProgram.c</SPAN>.

<P>
    Note: Normally you should only include source files in your
    repository. Unless specifically requested <SPAN CLASS="textbf">do not</SPAN> commit
    executable files to your svn repositories.

<P>
    </LI>
<LI>Now <SPAN CLASS="textbf">add</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="textbf">commit</SPAN> the files to your svn
    repository.
